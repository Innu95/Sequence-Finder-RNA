# Sequence-Finder-RNA
Sequence finder in a RNA path 

I bring to options: 

1. The code in .py extension for making changes if you need it.
2. The same code in a executable form (.exe)

Both offer us the posibility to find a sequence of nucleotides that first we introduce and bring us the number of times that appear and the position/s where appear. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intructions: 

1. Write the path file (the .txt).
2. Write the sequence that you are looking for.
3. See the results.



PS 1: I add two .txt extensions to use it as a example. The one with the name RNA its just a little sequence where you can practise how the program works, the second one that calls seq_cov.txt its the COVID-19 RNA sequence downloaded here:

PS 2: The .exe file you can find it on my drive: " https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vJpBq7J_1oE8FyCJzwgDkgh04L04I-Lv/view?usp=sharing "
