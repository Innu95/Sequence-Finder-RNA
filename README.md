# Sequence-Finder-RNA
Sequence finder in a RNA path 

I bring to options: 

1. The code in .py extension for making changes if you need it.
2. The same code in a executable form (.exe)

Both offer us the posibility to find a sequence of nucleotides that first we introduce and bring us the number of times that appear and the position/s where appear.

Intructions: 

1. Write the path file (the .txt).
2. Write the sequence that you are looking for.
3. See the results.
